/*
   Question: TestDome - TrainComposition
   Solution by Arash Partow 2014

   A TrainComposition is built by attaching and detaching wagons from the
   left and the right sides.

   For example, if we start by attaching wagon 7 from the left followed
   by attaching wagon 13, again from the left, we get a composition of
   two wagons (13 and 7 from left to right). Now the first wagon that can
   be detached from the right is 7 and the first that can be detached
   from the left is 13.

   Implement a TrainComposition that models this problem.

#include <stdexcept>
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>

class TrainComposition
{
public:

	void attachWagonFromLeft(int wagonId)
	{
		train_.push_front(wagonId);
	}

	void attachWagonFromRight(int wagonId)
	{
		train_.push_back(wagonId);
	}

	int detachWagonFromLeft()
	{
		int result = train_.front();
		train_.pop_front();
		return result;
	}

	int detachWagonFromRight()
	{
		int result = train_.back();
		train_.pop_back();
		return result;
	}

private:

	std::deque<int> train_;
};

#ifndef RunTests
int main()
{
	TrainComposition tree;
	tree.attachWagonFromLeft(7);
	tree.attachWagonFromLeft(13);
	std::cout << tree.detachWagonFromRight() << "\n"; // 7
	std::cout << tree.detachWagonFromLeft(); // 13
}
#endif
